# Volta

A simple 2D walking simulator framework thingy for the Godot Engine.
It's a fun little project I'm working on to relax.

Godot version: 3.4.3

## Ideas

* Events:

  Change the structure of Event objects.
  Functionality based on components and not on inheritance.

* Dhall:

  Use the Dhall language to create json files.
  Maybe make a Dhall parser? Maybe lol.
